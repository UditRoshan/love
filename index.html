      Two galaxies behind your gaze, They pull me in, I lose my ways. In silent stares, the stars align, And all the world feels more divine.

      <p>I don’t know where to start, but I have to start somewhere… So… Here goes nothing → You are the love of my life. From the first day I met you to this day, I have loved you and will continue to do so until the end of my life. Whenever someone talks about love, your face pops up in my head; your name resonates through my mind. It’s hard to describe in words the amount of love I have for you in my heart. The only wish I have is to be with you for the rest of my life and die knowing that I had the privilege of being loved by YOU. Take care of yourself because there are so many years ahead, and I want you to spend all those years happily. I promise to be there with you forever, holding your hand as tightly as I can. <span>Happy Birthday & I Love You.</span> </p>
